# AlternativeScreenLocker
In my win10 everthing is wrong. The default screen locker make my computer hibernate just after locking.
So I made my own and now I dont use the original even tough it still exists.

You can always run it in a friend computer to mess with him :) !

Probably wont be updated ever :p
